# Myss

A derivative project from [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/tree/master). This repo reused lots of breakwall's code, such as `encrypt`, `asyncdns` module and policy to handling timeout connection. Compared with origin shaodowsocks, the main improvement is:

- simplified event handling process in `tcprelay`

- seperate local and remote code in `tcprelay`

- redesigned `lru_cache`. now there's no need to sweep cache periodically

- add `DNS Asynchronous Parse` function to udp forwarding

- add native gfw list support

## install

you can install this package using pip(depend on git cmd tool)

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/wcsjtu/myss.git
```

or download source code, then

```shell
cd .
python setup.py install
```

## usage

Suppose `myss` have been installed according to tutorial above, you can see the usage of how to start myss server:

```shell
myss server --help      # see detail help info about start myss server
```

or start myss local by:

```shell
myss local -c path_to_config_file
```

If you won't install it, you can download the source code, and start myss service by:

```shell
cd myss
python manage.py server --help
```

## TODO

- daemon mode
- improve performance of handling gfw list
- flow control
- ipv6 support
- more
